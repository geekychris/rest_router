Implement a router for rest calls.  Assume that rest uri's contain as part of their uri pah include the service name as part of the uri, such as http://mycompany.com/servicea/path vs http://mycompany.com/serviceb/path.
This service should use techniques such as none blocking io for effiency.
Implement some type of rate limiting requests.  these rates should be definable per service.  
All requests without payload should be logged to a log file or kafka.
The service should support plugins so that messages can be shaped / augmented or filtered.
Assume this service will be horrizontably scalable.
Implement this using java 21 and spring.
It should also be possible to route to multiple backend services even with the same uri based upon uri parameters or header parameters.  This would be primarily to support a/b testing.
Include tests.
